# Transaction-Processing-Fraud-Analysis-System
A Python + SQL project that transforms raw banking transaction data into a clean, normalized database.
The ETL pipeline cleans and validates customer, account, merchant, and transaction data, loads it into MSSQL, and enables SQL-based fraud and pattern analysis.

Includes:
Python scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)
MSSQL schema with dimension and fact tables
Example SQL queries and views for fraud analytics
Documentation on project setup and workflow

This project demonstrates data engineering, database design, and SQL analytics skills with realistic banking data.
